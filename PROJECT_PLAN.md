   - Loving-kindness phrases

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
4. **Guided Visualizations**
   - Safe place imagery
   - Calming nature scenes
   - Progressive visualization

5. **Crisis Support**
   - Emergency grounding protocol
   - Crisis resource directory
   - Distress tolerance skills

### Phase 3: Personalization
6. **Adaptive Experience**
   - Tool recommendations
   - Session tracking (local only)
   - Personalized shortcuts

## Technical Architecture
